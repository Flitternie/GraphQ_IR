<h1>fig</h1>

fig is a system to help people who run many experiments/simulations with many
different parameters keep their results organized.<p>

Concretely, suppose you a program that can be run with many different
settings and each run generates some output files.
fig will automatically place each run in a separate directory
and provides a powerful web interface to view/organize these runs.<p>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>

The web interface has been designed to be (1) uniform in design, (2)
powerful, and (3) keyboard-friendly.  There is a learning curve, but
advanced users will hopefully find it very easy to do what they
want.<p>

At a high-level, the interface provides a way of navigating and
operating on a virtual file system.  Each item in this file system is
identified by a trail.  Each item also has any number of children.
A standard set of navigation operations allows one to traverse
the file system to the desired trail.  At any item,
pretty much the same set of operations for creating, deleting, copying
items apply.<p>

<ol>
  <li>Now let's go to the servlet <tt>http://localhost:8080/fig</tt>.
  Essentially, the fig interface sits lightly on top of a virtual file system;
  each table displays a trail (path) to some item or view.
  We are currently at the root item.
  You should see a table with two rows/items: <tt>baskets</tt> and <tt>domains</tt>.
  <li>Let's go into <tt>domains</tt> by clicking anywhere on the row;
  note that the black arrow on the left points to that row.
  Click on that arrow.  If you like the keyboard, use vi keys
  (<tt>h, j, k, l</tt>)
  to move around and then press <tt>o</tt> to open it.
  <li>
  Now, we are in the domains view, which should be empty.
  Each domain corresponds to a project you are working on,
  and concretely, a different <tt>state/execs</tt> directory.
  To create a new domain, hit <tt>shift-n</tt> (you can also find it in the actions menu).
  Type in <tt>examples</tt> for the item name.
  A new row should appear.
  We can edit the description by double-clicking on appropriate cell
  (row <tt>examples</tt>, column <tt>description</tt>)---or navigate over
  and press <tt>shift-e</tt>.
  This description will be saved on disk.
  If you don't believe me, check out <tt>fig/servlet/var/domains/examples.index</tt>.
  We also need to edit the <tt>domainDir</tt> field,
  which we should set to full path the <tt>state</tt> directory
  that we created, for example, <tt>/home/pliang/fig/examples/examples/state</tt>.
  <li>Let's proceed on into <tt>examples</tt> (<tt>o</tt> or click on the left arrow).
  Now, we are at the domain item identified by trail <tt>domains | examples</tt>.
  Proceed into <tt>execs</tt>.
  If you see all zeros, don't be alarmed;
  just hit <tt>shift-r</tt> to reload; you might have to do this more than once.
  The reason for this odd behavior is that the servlet doesn't
  keep you hanging while it goes out to disk to reloads, so it
  just gives you what it has, but your reload request prompts
  the servlet to load so next time, things should be up to date.
  <li>Go into <tt>(all)</tt>, and we should see our execution
  along with some information such as the time, status, memory.
  <li>We can make notes about each run by modifying the <tt>note</tt>
  column at the end (double-click or type <tt>shift-e</tt> on it).
</ol>

<h4>Adding new fields</h4>
<ol>
  <li>First, let's start with adding another column to this table.
  Hit <tt>ctrl-d</tt> to replicate the table.
  (Use <tt>ctrl-f</tt> and <tt>ctrl-b</tt> to jump between tables.)
  <li>On the lower table, let's go back up the trail to the parent by
  hitting <tt>u</tt> or click the black upward-pointing arrow in the
  upper-left corner of the table.
  <li>We should be back at the domain item.
  Go into <tt>fieldSpecs</tt>.  A fieldSpec (field specification)
  describes which columns of a table should be displayed.
  <li>Let's create a new fieldSpec by hitting <tt>shift-n</tt>
  and calling it <tt>default</tt>.
  <li>Now, we're going to copy <tt>(execs)</tt> into default.
  To do this, check <tt>(execs)</tt> by clicking on the checkbox
  or navigating over and hitting <tt>x</tt>.
  Type <tt>y</tt> to add it to the clipboard (basket).
  Go into <tt>default</tt> and press <tt>p</tt> to paste it.
  Hit <tt>shift-z</tt> to clear the clipboard.
  <li>Now, to create a new field, hit <tt>shift-n</tt>
  and call it <tt>result</tt>.
  Edit the <tt>data</tt> to be <tt>$count.map:result</tt>
  (double-click on it or press <tt>shift-e</tt>).
  This will tell the servlet to look in the <tt>count.map</tt>
  file and pull out the line with <tt>result</tt> as the key.
  Also edit <tt>displayName</tt> to be <tt>result</tt>.
  <li>Now, go to the table that's on the trail <tt>domains | examples | execs | (all)</tt>
  and hit <tt>shift-r</tt> to refresh.
  A new <tt>result</tt> column should show up with the value 12.
</ol>

<h4>Manipulating executions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If we have a lot of executions, we want to group them
  into folders rather than looking at <tt>(all)</tt>.
  Go up to <tt>domains | examples | execs</tt> by pressing <tt>u</tt>.
  <li>Hit <tt>shift-n</tt> to create a new execution view.
  If you're lazy, you can leave the name empty, and it will
  automatically fill it in with a distinct number
  (there's always the description field if you want to be informative).
  <li>Go into <tt>(all)</tt>, check <tt>0.exec</tt>,
  copy it to the clipboard by hitting <tt>y</tt>,
  go back into <tt>domains | examples | execs | 0</tt>
  and paste it by hitting <tt>p</tt>.
  No files are actually copied: we are simply manipulating
  references.
  <li>We can also remove an execution from this view:
  check it and type <tt>a r enter</tt> (note that this is actually
  selecting the action from the actions menu).
  Important: for this removal to have any effect,
  we need to save it by typing <tt>a s enter</tt>.
  Note that removal doesn't delete anything on disk;
  it simply removes it from this view.
  <li>Purging is different.  To purge an execution,
  check it and type <tt>a p enter</tt>.
  After purging, we won't be able to see it on the web servlet 
  anymore (but in fact, the file was just renamed to
  <tt>0.exec.purged</tt>, which you have to go delete manually).
  <li>While an execution is running
  type <tt>a k enter</tt> to kill it.
  All this does is create a file called <tt>kill</tt>
  in the execution directory, which is picked up by <tt>execwrapper</tt>.
  Press <tt>shift-r</tt> to refresh and note that the status
  has changed from <tt>running</tt> to <tt>killed</tt>.
</ol>
